# ElevateLabs_Task4

## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. Each row represents a tumor sample with 30 numerical features, and the target variable indicates whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

## Steps Performed

### 1. Import and Preprocess the Dataset
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`.
- Dropped irrelevant columns like `id` and `Unnamed: 32`.
- Converted the `diagnosis` column:
  - `M` (Malignant) ‚Üí `1`
  - `B` (Benign) ‚Üí `0`
- Split the data into features (`X`) and target (`y`).

### 2. Split Data and Standardize Features
- Used `train_test_split()` to divide the data into:
  - 80% training data
  - 20% test data
- Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize the feature values to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

### 3. Fit a Logistic Regression Model
- Used `LogisticRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model` to train the model.
- Trained the model using scaled training data.

### 4. Evaluate the Model
- Made predictions on the test data.
- Evaluated the model using:
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
  - **ROC-AUC Score** (Area under the ROC curve)
  - **ROC Curve** plot to visualize performance across thresholds

### 5. Visualize the Sigmoid Function
- Plotted the **Sigmoid Function**, which converts the linear model output (z) into probabilities between 0 and 1.
- Explained how threshold tuning affects classification decisions.

## Interpretation

- A **high ROC-AUC** indicates strong model performance.
- The **confusion matrix** helps identify false positives and false negatives.
- The **sigmoid curve** helps understand the decision boundary and how predictions are made from probabilities.
- Tuning the **threshold** can help balance between sensitivity (recall) and specificity.
